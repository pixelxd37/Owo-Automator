# Owo-Automator
This can be used to automate Owo hunt and battle commands without getting banned

## How It Works
1. **Messages Sent**:
   - **"owo hunt"**: This message is sent first.
   - **"owo battle"**: This message follows shortly after the "owo hunt" message.

2. **Countdown Intervals**:
   - **"owo hunt"** is sent after a random countdown between **15 to 25 seconds**.
   - **"owo battle"** is sent after a random countdown between **1 to 5 seconds** after "owo hunt".
   - This cycle continues, with "owo hunt" being sent first, followed by "owo battle".

## How to Use
1. **Download** the `AutoOwo.exe` file.
2. **Run** the executable on your computer.
3. **Focus** on the text box where you want the messages to be typed.
4. Press `Ctrl + Shift` to start sending messages.
5. Close the application using the cross button to stop the program.

## Requirements
- No additional software is needed to run the executable.
